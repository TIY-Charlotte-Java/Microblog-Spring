  * Click Next and Finish
* Create `home.html` in the templates directory
  * It should display a login form like the first screenshot
* Create a controller class next to the main application class
* In your controller, create a route for `/`
  * It should take the model and the request as arguments
  * It should read the username from the session and add it to the model
  * It should return the home template
* In your controller, create a route for `/login`
